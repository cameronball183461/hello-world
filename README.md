# hello-world


first assignment


My name is Cameron. I like to run and I also do Krav-Maga (an Israli martial art). This is my fourth semester in computer engineering at BYUI. I am from Pleasant View Utah, but my family is currently in Brigham City. I served my mission in Medellin Colombia 2 years ago.
